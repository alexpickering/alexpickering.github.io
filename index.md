## Introduction

My name is Alex Pickering. I'm a student looking for opportunities to transition into a computer science career. As a practiced writer with a Bachelor's degree in English, I have a unique take on the field. 


## A Series of Grandiose Claims

I was brought to Computer Science by technology's promise for our future. Namely, that computing machines can, in theory, solve _any solvable problem._ This claim, while relying heavily on the notion that any problem can be imported into the rather concrete and formalized realm of computer science, is shocking in its implications. As a humanist with a lot invested in the maturation of civilizations and the collective flourishing of minds on a global scale, the best ladder for extricating ourselves from the mess of impulse and violence of our past and elevating us further towards the skies is one constructed wrung by wrung due to the dedicated work of computer scientists (and scientists broadly, though I clearly have romanticized one branch above the rest). The way computing allows us to stairstep our way closer to final science is truly a thrill, and a journey worth all of the time and energy I can provide it. 

Similarly, as someone who has always appreciated the beauty of language as a method to convey approximate meaning (in fact, a compromise of meaning between otherwise entirely disperate consciousnesses), I've found the idea of code as a formalization of logical thought to be enticing, even approaching poetic when finesse is exercised.
