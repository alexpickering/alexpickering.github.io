## or An Uneasy Foray Into Conversing Alone

A few weeks ago, I was informed by one of my favorite podcasts that blogs are dead.[^1] As is my nature, I have decided to take this time to announce my journey into the wonderous ruins of the blogdom.

| *It was such a technologically advanced society. I wonder what happened...*|

Most of my life, I have pursued thought provoking conversations, occasionally to the exclusion of more profitable ventures. As a college trained writer (B.A. in English from Ohio State University[^2]) with interests in technology, stories and storytelling, and navigating societal turmoil via rational conversation, the next step in my development seemed obvious: go to the digital wishing well, and toss in my two cents (more metal than water in there these days, but I'll get to that).

Of course, the idea of conversing without an interlocutor makes me a bit nervous. To paraphrase Mortimer Adler,[^3] we're playing a game of catch, you and I, and, as such, it's in my best interest to throw in a way you can't help but catch. I'll be doing my damnedest to convey exactly what I mean, but I can't really know if you're catching it without feedback. To that end, I welcome responses to the ideas presented here. If I never fail, I never grow, and I've already wasted too much time being okay. __I don't want to be okay.__ I want to be _better._

## Getting to That: Nobody Goes There Anymore; It's Too Crowded

As discussed on the podcast I mentioned earlier[^1], the medium is pretty saturated. Everyone has thoughts and opinions, everyone thinks they're special and worthy of your attention, everyone has a blog, or vlog, or podcast, or YouTube channel they'd love you to read, watch, like, favorite, or subscribe to. I get that, and I have no illusions about being _the_ definitive content creator (_cringe_) for you. Mostly because I'm new to this. And we can only ever start from the beginning.

Still, I wouldn't be telling the whole truth if I didn't say this: I hope you stick around.

Best,
Alex Pickering
