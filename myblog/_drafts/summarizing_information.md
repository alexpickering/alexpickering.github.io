## Deciding What to Chew: On Books and Their Summaries

Your friend comes over to play video games. Gears of War #. Amidst the extraction of guts and viscera, you find occasion to pick up ammunition. You offhandedly praise free markets. Your friend grabs a rhetorical bat, gives it a few swings. Still joking, you kick out with a "Fuck the system" to the ribs and a "Money decides elections, anyway" to the cheek in anarcho-punk style, complete with facial snarl and requisite tone-deafness. He sighs, dropping the sardonic facade, and says none-too-optimistically "Yeah man, Capitalism is so fucked." Slightly dismayed that your facetious jeers were misunderstood as structural cynicism, you shake the [adjective] can of spray paint, and tag the pillars of the Temple of Dagon with a hammers and sickles wrapped around everyone's neck. Metaphorically. Okay, you make joke at Communism's expense. Your friend doesn't laugh.

It's 3 am, and the Reddit thread you're reading is full of comments explaining economic nuance to a level you can't understand, much less repeat. In fact, it does more work to erode your self-assuredness in the few things you did know than adding anything useful to your working understanding of macro-economic systems. You open a few links to thirty page excerpts from half-century old books. There are a lot of words you don't know. There are a lot of concepts you have to Google. You lose focus after the first few pages and decide to 'research' how-to-get-better-at-reading. Then, how-to-get-better-at-reading-reddit. The thread you discover discourages subvocalization (DON'T READ THIS ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD) and extols the value of consistent practice. Setting a goal. Routine. You decide to read.

[Light percolates between your eyelids, and the blur coheres into a visual plane.]

You're reading Gone Girl by January third and are halfway through Good Omens when you get distracted. Life is busy. Drinks are tasty. If changing your perspective is the goal, alcohol does the trick more easily. You hear good things about meditation, only 10 minutes a day. Day job, grocery store, new season of Daredevil, drinks with coworkers, drinks with friends, a conversation about college majors. Somebody asks, you tell them humanities, hope it's a deep enough trench that you won't risk your head. They fire again. English, you admit, and when they ask what you think of Chaucer, you do what most of your essay-writing experience has taught you to do and prevaricate. They nod their heads.

You decide to read some classic literature. You stumble onto r/literature. You ask about the difference between [two slightly different genres in the same period] and are roundly and rightly castigated as a philistine. 

After appropriate panic, you decide to take action. Ascend above the hoi polloi. Hamlet ought to be a great start. It's cheap on Kindle, and make it most of the way through before losing
