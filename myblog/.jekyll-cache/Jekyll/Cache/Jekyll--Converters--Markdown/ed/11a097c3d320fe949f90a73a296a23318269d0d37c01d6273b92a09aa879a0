<p>I was lucky enough to be disabused of the fear of eternal damnation in late high school, surrounded by punks and smartasses equiped with just enough logic to disarm the family heirloom of protestant faith. In hindsight, most of the tools they used were crude, but Iâ€™m forever grateful for those conversations as a nascent form of my adoption of rationality and embracing secular humanism.</p>
