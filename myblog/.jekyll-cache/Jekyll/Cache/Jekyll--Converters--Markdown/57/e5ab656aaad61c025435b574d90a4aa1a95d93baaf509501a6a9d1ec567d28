<p>A few weeks ago, I was informed by one of my favorite podcasts that blogs are dead.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> As is my nature, I have decided to take this time to announce my journey into the wonderous ruins of the blogdom.</p>

<p>Most of my life, I have pursued thought provoking conversations, occasionally to the exclusion of more profitable ventures. As a college trained writer (B.A. in English from Ohio State University<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) with interests in technology, stories and storytelling, and navigating societal turmoil via rational conversation, the next step in my development seemed obvious: go to the digital wishing well, and toss in my two cents (more metal than water in there these days, but Iâ€™ll get to that).</p>

<p>Of course, the idea of conversing without an interlocutor makes me a bit nervous. To paraphrase Mortimer Adler,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> weâ€™re playing a game of catch, you and I, and, as such, itâ€™s in my best interest to throw in a way you canâ€™t help but catch. Iâ€™ll be doing my damnedest to convey exactly what I mean, but I canâ€™t really know if youâ€™re catching it without feedback. To that end, I welcome responses to the ideas presented here. If I never fail, I never grow, and Iâ€™ve already wasted too much time being okay. <strong>I donâ€™t want to be okay.</strong> I want to be <em>better.</em></p>

<p>As discussed on the podcast I mentioned earlier<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the medium is pretty saturated. Everyone has thoughts and opinions, everyone thinks theyâ€™re special and worthy of your attention, everyone has a blog, or vlog, or podcast, or YouTube channel theyâ€™d love you to read, watch, like, favorite, or subscribe to. I get that, and I have no illusions about being <em>the</em> definitive content creator (<em>cringe</em>) for you. Mostly because Iâ€™m new to this. And we can only ever start from the beginning.</p>

<p>Still, I wouldnâ€™t be telling the whole truth if I didnâ€™t say this: I hope you stick around.</p>

<p>Best,
Alex Pickering</p>
