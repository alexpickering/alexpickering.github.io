![Alex Pickering](https://alexpickering.netlify.com/assets/img/profile_pic_small.PNG)



Alex Pickering is a writer and philosopher interested in using conversation to bridge the gaps between disparate political and moral positions. A left-leaning centrist, Alex is dedicated to deracinating dogma and institutional irrationality wherever it can be found, and is especially committed to dislodging these dangers from his own mind. 

Alex received a B.A. in English from Ohio State University in 2016 with minors in creative writing and philosophy. Incidentally, he discovered a decent optimization strategy for unemployability. He is currently working on publishing his writing, but is still finding his own footing. He wishes to keep no more than one foot in his own mouth at a time.
