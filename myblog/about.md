![Alex Pickering](/home/taka0/alexpickering.github.io/myblog/assets/img/profile_pic_small.PNG)



Alex Pickering is a writer and philosopher interested in using conversation to bridge the gaps between disparate political and moral positions. A left-leaning centrist, Alex is dedicated to deracinating dogma and institutional irrationality wherever it can be found, and is especially committed to extricating these dangers from his own mind. 



Alex received a B.A. in English from Ohio State University in 2016 (with a minors in creative writing and philosophy[^1]). He is currently working on publishing his writing, but is still finding his own footing. He wishes to keep no more than one foot in his own mouth at a time.
